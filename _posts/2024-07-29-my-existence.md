## My Existence
{: .text-center}

<div class="poem" markdown="1" align="center">
The walls of my memory and existence, have been painted over and over,<br>
The colors you see today, are not the first I owned,<br>
The texture then was chalky not smooth, with limestone all over,<br>
What you see today is a facade, my clothes rented, my expressions – loaned.

But every now and then, when a nail is driven into these walls,<br>
An intent to hang a decree, or an accomplishment on display,<br>
The facade chips off, and the inside is revealed (outside crawls),<br>
Those memories peep out, see the light of the day.

Then eventually, a certificate hangs on it, and the chips are plastered,<br>
Little if not none, can be driven by the soul,<br>
And unless a balance of ambition and devotion is mastered,<br>
There may never be enough, enough to fill the bowl.

I'm not saying, that my entire existence is a facade,<br>
Not everything is for appearance - insulated walls hollow within,<br>
But please reckon, that a mortal's judgment can get flawed,<br>
When comfort gets painted over and over, soul will struggle in efforts to be seen,

My failures have made me as much, as much as the successes if any,<br>
But I too prefer to linger on the memories that comfort.<br>
I too, have been discouraged by the failures of the many,<br>
Into a habit of avoiding pain and the emotions unconquered.

And, unless the layers are sanded, and uniformed for the makeover,<br>
The present will be driven to hide the guilts of the past,<br>
Unless every once in a while, the conscience takes over,<br>
It is hard to find sustenance, but who knows – maybe my existence will last.

## On the Layers We Build
{: .mt-4}

This poem emerged from a moment of recognition - watching *The Great Debaters* and hearing about Gandhi's Satyagraha, I was struck by how words and concepts that once felt deeply mine had become distant, painted over by layers of time and experience. The first line came immediately: "The walls of my memory and existence, have been painted over and over."

The metaphor grew from memories of my childhood home in Dakra, where walls were chalky limestone - rough, authentic, owned. Now everything feels rented, borrowed, carefully curated for display. It's remarkable how that single image of painted walls became a lens for examining the gap between who we were and who we present ourselves to be.

## The Rhythm of Discovery

What fascinates me about writing poetry is how the first line often sets not just the rhythm, but the entire emotional trajectory. Each stanza's opening line seems to lay groundwork for thoughts I didn't know I was going to explore. The rhymes - "plastered and mastered," "makeover and takes over" - weren't planned but emerged organically, pulling new ideas forward.

The line about "hiding the guilts of the past" surprised me as I wrote it. I found myself wondering what drew me to that phrase, whether it reflected my current emotional state, my tendency to avoid uncomfortable truths - even something as simple as checking difficult correspondence.

## On Failures and Facades

While writing, I was watching a show about Abraham Lincoln, and those idealized, morally unambiguous scenes sparked something in me. It led to what became the second-to-last stanza - the recognition that our failures shape us as much as, if not more than, our successes. Yet we naturally gravitate toward the memories that comfort us, building habits of avoidance around pain and unconquered emotions.

The poem asks whether there's a practical way to "sand the layers" in real life - to find our way back to that authentic foundation beneath all the protective coatings we've applied. Perhaps the answer lies in those moments when the facade chips off naturally, when we drive a nail into the wall and catch a glimpse of what lies beneath.
