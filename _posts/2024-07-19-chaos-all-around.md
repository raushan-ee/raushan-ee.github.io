## Chaos All Around
{: .text-center}

<div class="poem" markdown="1" align="center">
Round and round, my mind goes around,<br>
I seem to feel nothing, I can hear no sound.<br>
In search of the peace, with the Chaos I found,<br>
My breath is in shackles, the mind is astound.

They say - get high on pills, embrace the confidence it instills,<br>
Silently stay alive, and watch - the silence kills.<br>
Ride the roller coaster, experience all its thrills,<br>
Yell at the highest highs, coz rest has no frills!

Chaos is a process, Not something you can profess,<br>
There is a method to this madness, many secret sauces,<br>
Speed has a thrill, sure, but more terror in the pauses,<br>
Wins keep you hooked, but aggression is in the losses.

Finger on the trigger, my panic grows bigger,<br>
Am I spiraling down, into my own grave digger?<br>
My mind is in disarray, thoughts have lost rigor,<br>
Is this vigorously ending, or is it the end of the vigor?

Maybe I need help, the emotions are starting to yelp,<br>
The body stays frozen, but the tears are starting to melt.<br>
Definitely drowning, no sun in my forest of kelp,<br>
Row me, row me away, Save me from myself!

## Written in the Eye of the Storm
{: .mt-4}

This poem emerged from anxiety - raw, immediate, and unfiltered. It came to life on July 19th, 2024, about three hours after experiencing a particularly severe panic attack. The heaviness in my head, the circular thoughts, the search for peace that somehow led me deeper into chaos - all of it poured out in these verses.

Some lines disturb me with how accurately they capture that state of mind - "Chaos is a process, Not something you can profess" or the observations about pills and dependency. These weren't planned thoughts; they surfaced from somewhere deeper, perhaps from the clarity that sometimes comes in the aftermath of crisis.

## On Mental Health and Seeking Help

Earlier that day, I had spoken with a nurse about my depression and ongoing mental health struggles. The conversation felt like a familiar dance - increase the Lexapro from 10mg to 15mg, maybe 20mg? Try Melatonin for sleep, 10mg about three hours before bed. When I asked about dependency, the response was telling: "No, but I have seen many patients feel dependent on it... And I say nothing wrong with that."

This interaction, coupled with the panic attack, crystallized something important for me about the nature of help and healing. There's a difference between support and dependency, between medication as a tool and medication as a crutch.

## A Message to Anyone Struggling
{: .mt-4}

If you're reading this and struggling with your life and mental health simultaneously, know that everything around you will feel disconcerting. You might feel alone - and maybe you do have good people around you, but ultimately, this is work you have to do for yourself.

The people in your life shouldn't become your Melatonin or your Lexapro. Don't place that burden on them or grow dependent on their presence for your stability. Seek professional help, work toward bouncing back, and then step forward independently.

I don't have all the answers yet. But I know I will figure it out - I have to. And when I do, I'll share what I learn, somehow. Because if you're in this space too, we'll figure it out together, even if we have to do the individual work alone.
