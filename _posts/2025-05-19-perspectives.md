## The Only Way is UP
{: .text-center}

<div class="poem" markdown="1" align="center">
You have won!<br>
This is the last time,<br>
I will rebuild my life again.

There is no other option.

The more I will try<br>
The more I will lose<br>
The more I believe in love<br>
The more I have been let down<br>


The situation can't improve!<br>
I don't think<br>
I learn from my mistakes.


My destiny<br>
Will determine<br>
My actions.

My resolve to fight back<br>
Has lost to<br>
My agony and suffering.

The truth won't come out.<br>
Do not believe that<br>
I will find redemption.

Forget my existence.<br>
The world will not<br>
Remember by name.

But, not any more!

## The Art of Reverse Poetry
{: .mt-4}

Reverse poems are a fascinating poetic structure that offers two completely different perspectives depending on how they're read. When read conventionally (top to bottom), this poem expresses feelings of defeat and hopelessness. However, when read in reverse (bottom to top), it transforms into a message of hope, resilience, and determination.

To fully experience both interpretations, I encourage you to:
1. First, read the poem as written from top to bottom
2. Then, read each stanza in reverse order (starting from the bottom)
3. Notice how the meaning completely changes with perspective

## My Inspiration
{: .mt-4}

A lot has happened to help me with the conviction to attempt this poem. Past two years have especially been challenging. Everything that I have known to be true - in personal life, has been tested on many levels. Amidst that, about 8 months ago, I found an ad from Honda - with a reverse poem with voice over by John Cena. I have been reading and writing poems for about 16 years then, but never came across the brilliance of this kind of story telling. I must have heard it like 30 times or more that day - and remained in awe. It remained in my mind - but never with a courage to write one myself. Yesterday, a very dear friend pushed me to start rebuilding my life - and somehow I felt more determination. Just then, the memory of this poem came to me - as I was writing about my goals. This is how, I wrote this poem. 

Perspective has been a key element in my ability to be strong, and believe that things can be turned around. A reverse poem literally embodies that idea in a physical form.

Having said that, I do miss the lack of rhymes in anything that is referred to as a poem. My education in the technicalities of this is limited. But, a story telling and structure like this has to be celebrated.

It is my hope, that you stumble across this poem and make it your own.
