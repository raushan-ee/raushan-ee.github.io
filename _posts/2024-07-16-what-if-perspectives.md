## What If
{: .text-center}

<div class="poem" markdown="1" align="center">
So many missed opportunities, so many missed roads,<br>
I wish you had it better, but we all bear our share of loads.<br>
So many what ifs, So many regrets,<br>
Wish we could let go, but the mind never forgets.

A road not taken, or a road that we missed,<br>
The one we felt good about, but the one we never kissed,<br>
Would that kiss or an attempt to such,<br>
Even make a difference, or would have mattered much?

No way to tell, no point in the ponder,<br>
It's another universe that revelation - a million miles yonder.<br>
And yet we can't help it, what all do we see,<br>
Our choices have made us, and the final decree.

How about a 'what if' dedicated to the future, not the past,<br>
It may be far fetched, but 'what if' we can make it last?<br>
'What if' we can focus on steering our present?<br>
'What if' we can begin engineering our first ascent!

But what about that cliff of turmoils, or those fears we avert?<br>
Well what about it? And some fear is good - it keeps us alert.<br>
'What if' we learn to ride - not fall off that cliff?<br>
'What if' we become grateful, and not wonder 'what if'!

So, I wish you some perspective, a serene sense of calm,<br>
An assurance that you're not alone, in your woes or your qualm.<br>
And even though we never met, never touched, or shared a view,<br>
Please know - with all my heart, I love you - I really do!

## The Power of Reframing
{: .mt-4}

This poem explores one of the most universal human experiences: the weight of "what if" thinking. We all carry moments of wondering about different choices, missed opportunities, and roads not taken. But what makes this reflection particularly meaningful is the shift it proposes - from dwelling on past possibilities to creating future ones.

The poem begins in familiar territory - the landscape of regret and missed connections. Yet it evolves into something more hopeful, suggesting that the same mental energy we spend on past "what ifs" could be redirected toward future possibilities. Instead of wondering what might have been, what if we asked what still could be?

## On Perspective and Love
{: .mt-4}

Perhaps the most striking element of this poem is its ending - a declaration of love to an unknown reader. It's a reminder that even in our most private moments of reflection and regret, we're connected to others who share similar struggles. The perspective offered here isn't just about reframing our thoughts, but about recognizing our shared humanity.

Sometimes the most profound shift in perspective comes not from changing how we see our circumstances, but from remembering that we're not alone in facing them.
