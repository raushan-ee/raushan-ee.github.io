## Where We Belong
{: .text-center}

<div class="poem" markdown="1" align="center">
Some say - where someone always thinks of us,<br>
That place, that place must be our home.<br>
Moving through make-shift abodes as nomads,<br>
In hopes of a home, as nomads we roam.

Alone in the crowds, our hearts haven't spoken,<br>
We stay in pursuit, we continue to long.<br>
Overwhelmed sometimes, but eyes lay woken,<br>
We keep searching, until we belong.

Dreaming to discover an end to the journey,<br>
To find a patch of land, a patch we call home,<br>
Surrounded or not, there, we can spend an eternity,<br>
In this place we find love, even when alone.

I wish you serenity, midst the turmoil you fight,<br>
May your struggles go swift, victories go slow,<br>
Whatever you do, may a home stay in sight,<br>
And when you do arrive, I hope you will know.
</div>

## Seeds of Recognition
{: .mt-4}

The first two lines of this poem arrived unexpectedly on July 20th, 2024, while sitting in the backyard of longtime friends I hadn't seen in a while. Something about that moment - the ease, the comfort, the feeling of being truly at home - struck me powerfully. Here I was, feeling more settled than I had in my own apartment back in Denver, and suddenly these words came gushing forth about the nature of home itself.

There's a paradox in that experience: finding home not in the place where we sleep, but in the presence of people who think of us, who hold space for us even when we're absent. It made me reflect on my own reluctance to return to my apartment, where solitude felt more like loneliness than peace.

## Time Capsules of Feeling

I completed the poem today, July 29th, when I rediscovered those initial lines. As I wrote, I kept thinking about the contradiction of feeling displaced in the very spaces meant to shelter us, while finding belonging in unexpected moments and places.

Only in retrospect might I understand the true purpose of these poems - they're intricate time capsules, storing moments I don't know what to do with. For now, they serve as notes and reminders, snapshots of feelings that might otherwise drift away unnamed. There's something oddly therapeutic about this process; I feel lighter after getting these lines out of my mind and onto paper.

## A Wish Forward

The final stanza emerged as I was writing these reflections, born from a desire to end on hope rather than longing. I often feel lost, uncertain of direction, out of sight of where I'm headed. These closing lines became a reminder - both to myself and to anyone who might need to hear it - that the ultimate goal of finding where we belong should stay in sight, even when the path seems unclear.

Sometimes the journey toward belonging is less about reaching a destination and more about recognizing the moments when we've already arrived, even temporarily, in spaces where our hearts can speak freely.
